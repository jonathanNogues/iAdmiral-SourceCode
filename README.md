## Project Revival

This repository is dedicated to preserving the legacy of iAdmiral and making it accessible to the community. The original developer, **Piotr Sarnowski**, graciously provided the source code, and this project aims to update and adapt it to work on modern iOS devices. The code is shared under the [GNU General Public License v3.0](./LICENSE), ensuring it remains free, open, and properly attributed.

## Challenges

The source code dates back to 2011 and was developed for a much older version of iOS. As a result, there are several compatibility issues, primarily related to the audio library used at the time. The original developer described the code as being of low quality and somewhat "ugly" since it was created as a learning project. However, the core gameplay mechanics remain intact, offering a solid foundation for revival.

## Current Status

- **Compatibility**: The code does not compile on modern versions of Xcode due to deprecated libraries and outdated APIs.
- **Screenshots & Logo**: We have recovered three in-game screenshots and the original app logo via archived web pages.
